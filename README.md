# hcccl_project
HCCCL Main Program using Presentation

# This is a base code to make HCCCL presentation experiment.


# The initial files consist of several components:

1. Library/
	lib_common_defaults.pcl
	lib_utilities.pcl
	lib_visual_pcl

2. Logfile/
	1-PrototypeExperiment.log
	1-PrototypeExperiment.txt

3. Stimuli/
	inside/
	outside/
	apple.bmp

4. English.xml

5. PrototypeExperiment.exp

6. PrototypeExperiment.sce

7. README.md


Each components play different roles:

1. Library: Act as a folder where we put external library related to input/output utilities and common library used in the main experiment code.

2. Logfile: This is where we save the output for each trials.

3. Stimuli: The folder function as a storage for stimuli pictures (e.g. fractals ).

4. English.xml: This is localization file based on what language used in the experiment.

5. PrototypeExperiment.exp: This is the Experiment configuration file. This is where we set version for the code and initialized default configuration and variables and setup for each trials.

6. PrototypeExperiment.sce: This is the main Presentation file. The main task and scenario for each task defined and programmed here. The main algorithm and procedure for the experiment is defined here.

7. README.md : The readme file for this project.
